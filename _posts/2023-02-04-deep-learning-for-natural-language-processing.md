## Introduction

Topic: [Computational Linguistics and Deep Learning](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/COLI_a_00239)

    Knowledge to keep in mind

- Deep Learning for NLP
- Mostly problem-driven
- Focused on English NLP

### Textbook

- [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
- [Speech and Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf)

### How to read papers

- Read the papers in context
  - All the papaers are built on top of other papers
- Grasp the key ideas
  - What is the biggest contribution of this paper
  - Why is this paper important?
- Pay attention to the details (both methodology and experiments)

### Topics of Interest

NLP problems at different levels:

- **Linguistic levels**: (speech), words, syntax, semantics
- **Intermediate tasks/tools**: parts-of-speech, entities, parsing, coreference
- **Full applications**: sentiment analysis, question answering, dialogue, text summarization, machine translation

Prominent problems in exitsting NLP systems:

- Bias in language data
- Annotation artifacts
- Interpretability
- Adversarial example
- General linguistic intelligence
